One of the youngest and most powerful nations on Tellirus, the Holy Empire of Aldain spans the globe. With land held on every contient, the wealth and diversity of Aldain continues to spread to its neighbours. Forging strong alliances and mercifully warring with those who share its borders, the Royal Armies maintain peace and loyalty to King Randus Achov throughout the provinces.

Driven by their unshakable faith in the Ardent Lady, the Aldinese crusade against the followers of Memphiatis. In the heart of Paluria, the Royal Third Army has captured the Cradle of Mankind and now marchers on the ancient city of Onbbassir. Intent on claiming it for their faith, the Third Army moves unperturbed by the looming threat of total war.

The Aldiense are a loyal, honourbound folk. Unity through faith gels together this amalgamation of cultures, ever adapting the underlying ideals and tenants which are shared across the North Seratane heartland. Good deeds trump bribes, and conflicts are oft settled through combat in Aldinese society.

Maintaing a base of operations in the Eye of Iren, the colonial Aldinese present in Irendairn represented a number of native cultures and bloodlines:
> Aldinese: the intrepid explorers and dutiful soldiers from North Seratane
> Irenoi: olive-skinned farmers from the foothills of the Irendairns
> Sulduori: nomadic wanderers from the northern Irendairns
> Parenish: paler than the Irenoi, the Parenish are woodland-dwellers from the southern Irendairns
> Bassiri: dark-skinned natives of the city and province of Onbassir
