The great courts of Phontoris are heard of far and wide. A flamboyant plutocracy, the Democratic Republic of Phontoris is far from a fair society. It is a nation ruled by the rich, from their towering holds on the desert wastes of South Seratane, with the poor subjected to the nation’s war and poverty. Directed by the ever-changing Premier, Phontoris has recently become a strong player on the world stage, its gradual change of faith from the Ardent Lady to Memphiatis securing it an allegiance with the Komerian Empire.

In the eternal quest for further riches and glorious to his name, Premier Tusendril commits his forces to Central Paluria. For many years, the Republic has been at odds with the colonies of the Aldinese. As their rivals move on the city of Onbassir, Phontoris’ military presence on the Amber Coast has increased rapidly, threatening the tenuous peace between the Holy Empire and its allies.

Having survived the conquests and the collapse of the Seratane Empire many centuries prior to the present day, the Republic of Phontoris has reaped the benefits of its easily-defensible homeland and its founders’ neutral stance on foreign policy. The extravagant nation continues to stretch across the Seratane Empire’s fractured corpse – war, marriage and trade absorbing the lesser states into its fold:
> Phontor: highborn, light-skinned explorers from the Republic’s heartland
> Seranese: brown-skinned natives of the remnants of the Seratane Empire, once known for their distinct architecture
> Littanish: privateers and raiders from the Free States of Littany, which stretches along the Amber Coast
> Talweish: natives of the Talwir Mountains and the Bay of Teeth
>  Bassiri: dark-skinned natives of the city and province of Onbassir
