Few nations are as ancient as the Empire of Komer Al. The subcontinent of Morieth has hosted the empire for more than two-thousand years, long before the War of Enlightenment. Seven hundred years ago, the Komerian Empire was restored to its original glory by Geth Thusorak, its government, religion and culture undergo radical changes into the theocratic imperium that it is today.

Conquest lies at the heart of Komerian society. As the figurehead of the Red Faith, which worships Memphiatis, it is the divine duty of the Komerian Empire to wage war on the heretical followers of the Ardent Lady. Now under the guidance of the recently-ascended Geth Vorask, the empire commits its people to the ever-shifting frontlines, particularly against the Aldinese expansionist efforts in Central Paluria.

The Komerians are ruthless and hostile towards outsiders. Their enemies which survive battle are forced into penal legions, slave labour or merely executed en-masse. Komerians are notoriously difficult to befriend or impress, often requiring one to undergo great feats to gain their trust. Needless to say, dissenters and deserters face a heavy price for their treason…

The rapid conquest of Erolur and Erokithisk in the last century, as well as the swift and efficient expansion into the broken civilsations of Paluria, have brought people of many cultures into the service of Komer Al:
> Komerian: dark-skinned warriors from the continent of Morieth, known for their fanaticism.
> Palurian: a mix of long-lost cultures, unified by their shared suffering at the hands of the Keroth, hailing from Eastern Paluria.
> Eroccine: merchants from the coasts of Erolur, known far and wide for their exotic goods and powerful medicines.
> Korrese: desert nomads from Korrenr, a province at the north end of the Valley of the Gods, sworn enemies of the Talweish.
>  Bassiri: dark-skinned natives of the city and province of Onbassir
